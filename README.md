# Repository where will be stored all the notes for preparing for some interviews and playground for me to practice frontend.

**Main goal of this repository is for me to prepare for Frontend Junior position. So this is a pretty note and at the same time playground for me to practice.**

Currently information prepared is for Frontend Junior position, in future will be updated for other positions (Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, etc.). Other types of interviews (technical, behavioral, etc.). Other levels of experience (Mid, Senior, etc.).

Feel free to use this information for your own preparation, but be aware that I am stupid student trying to lend my first full time job. So I will do mistakes and I will explain some things in a weird way understandable for me.

If you need just to read, this site is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and you can find it [here](https://prep-info.vercel.app/).

## Junior Frontend Developer preparation (team call + last technical interview)

As I mentioned before, this is a note and at the same time playground for me to practice.

## Getting Started

This is nextjs project. So you need to have node.js installed.
Check if you have node.js installed:

```bash
node -v
```

If you do not have node.js installed, you can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

If you have node.js installed, you can install dependencies:
(before it do not forget to clone this repository, obviously)

```bash
npm install
```

If you have dependencies installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
If you are doing this before I've changed home page to have sections for each topic, and it have only frontend topics. Change it to have multiple sections, and add Frontend Junior section, so it redirects to current / page.
